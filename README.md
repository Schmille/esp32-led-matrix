This library is only for MAX7219.

This library's original version was written for ESP8266, and was adapted by nhatuan84 to work with ESP32.
Originally this library was used in [this](http://www.iotsharing.com/2017/05/how-to-use-arduino-esp32-to-display-spi-led-matrix.html) tutorial on [IOTSHARING.COM](iotsharing.com).
gdampf later added support for 90Â° rotated displays as well as support for some additional characters and optimisations.

Unfortunately I was not able to get either version working, thus this repository was created.

To install the library, just clone the repository and copy it Arduino/libraries folder.
(usually C:\Users\User\Documents\Arduino\libraries)
